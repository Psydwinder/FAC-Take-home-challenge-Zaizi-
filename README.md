## What is the Monty Hall problem? 

The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle, named after the host of the game show Let's Make a Deal, Monty Hall.

The premise of the problem is that there are **three doors**, behind two of the doors are goats and behind one of them a brand new car.

- The contestant is first asked to pick one door, for example door #1
- The host knowing whats behind each of the doors, then opens one of the incorrect doors to show there is a goat behind it, for example door #3
- The host then gives the contestant the option to stick with the door they originally chose or switch to door #2

Herein lies the problem 

**Do you stick with door #1** or **switch to door #2?**
